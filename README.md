# Tutorial
## Getting Started
When you first Speedrun Companion, you will be greeted with a GUI with multiple tabs. The Start tab is where everything is controlled, but first we need to take a look at the other tabs in order to get Speedrun Companion set up. Please follow through this entire guide in order to understand what everything does.
### The Start Tab
The Start Tab is what Speedrun Companion will greet you with when it is opened. From here you can start RSG practice routines, SSG practice routines, or dive into running RSG, SSG, or FSG. When you are done you can close all relevant apps here as well as clear your saves folder automatically.

* *Start FSG/RSG Practice* - 
* *Start SSG Practice* - 
* *Start RSG* - 
* *Start SSG* - 
* *Start FSG* - 
* *Close All Apps* - 
* *Clear Saves Folder* - 
### Options
* *Global Gamemodes* - If enabled, the hotkeys specified in the Hotkeys tab for changing your gamemode to spectator, creative, and survival will be enabled at all times while Speedrun Companion is open. If disabled, the hotkeys specified will only be active during practice modes.
* *Abuse Planar in RSG* - This setting only applies for windowed borderless users. If enabled, during RSG runs, hitting the toggle hotkey for windowed borderless (as specified in the hotkeys tab) will toggle between normal windowed borderless and a stretched window. This allows you to see more with planar fog and is helpful for spotting structures in the nether. If this is disabled, hitting the toggle hotkey for windowed borderless during RSG runs will simply toggle between windowed borderless and normal windowed.
* *Select Minecraft Launcher* - Please select the Minecraft launcher you use from this drop down menu. The only supported ones are the Official (default) Launcher and MultiMC. I highly reccomend MultiMC as it is great at managing instances. This field allows Speedrun Companion to automatically startup Minecraft.
* *Select Recording Software* - Please select the recording software you use. The only supported softwares are Streamlabs OBS and OBS Studio. If you use OBS Studio please make sure you set up a hotkey to start/stop recording as you are asked for this in the Hotkeys tab. This field allows Speedrun Companion to open/close OBS and start/stop recording.
* *Select Window Mode* - Please select which window mode you use. There are 3 options, windowed, windowed borderless, and fullscreen. This field allows Speedrun Companion to know what your minecraft window looks like and whether or not to enable its built in windowed borderless functionality.
### Hotkeys
If you are not going to use one of the hotkeys listed below, it may be left blank
* *Toggle Windowed Borderless* - This is your hotkey for toggling windowed borderless on and off.
* *Cycle Mode* - This is your hotkey for cycling between practice worlds in RSG/FSG Practice Mode or SSG Practice Mode.
* *Reset* - This is your reset hotkey for RSG, SSG, and FSG.

### File Paths
If you don not use one of the programs below, it may be left blank
* *Minecraft Launcher Path* - Please put the full file path to your Minecraft launcher here (ex. A:\Minecraft Directory\MultiMC\MultiMC.exe). This allows Speedrun Companion to open Minecraft
* *Minecraft Saves Path* - Please put the full file path to your Minecraft saves folder here (ex. A:\Minecraft Directory\MultiMC\instances\1.16.1\.minecraft\saves). This allows Speedrun Companion to delete your worlds when you press the Clear Saves Folder button
* *OBS Path* - Please put the full file path to your recording software here (ex. C:\Program Files\Streamlabs OBS\Streamlabs OBS.exe). This allows Speedrun Companion to open your recording software
* *Tracker Path* - If you use Talking Mime's RSG reset tracker please put the path to a shortcut leading to the tracker here. (ex. C:\Users\user\Downloads\resetTracker). I have found that you have to make a shortcut to the resetTracker.exe and then give the path of that shortcut to Speedrun Companion in order for it to work. This allows Speedrun Companion to open your reset tracker.
* *LiveSplit Path* - Please put the full file path to LiveSplit here (ex. D:\Saved Games\LiveSplit\LiveSplit.exe). This allows Speedrun Companion to open LiveSplit.
* *LiveSplit RSG Splits Path* - Please put the full file path to your LiveSplit RSG splits file here (ex. D:\Saved Games\LiveSplit\Splits\Minecraft Java Edition - Any% RSG.lss). This allows Speedrun Companion to open your splits.
* *LiveSplit SSG Splits Path* - Please do the same as above but with your SSG splits
* *LiveSplit FSG Splits Path* - Please do the same as above but with your FSG splits
